# Buffr Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 7, 2026

## Overview

Buffr ("the App") is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your data is stored locally on your device — never on our servers. We don't have accounts, we don't track you, and we don't sell data.

This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it's used, and your choices.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- **No account or login** — You don't need to create an account to use Buffr.
- **No personal identifiers** — We don't collect your name, email, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.
- **No location tracking** — The App does not access your GPS or location data.
- **No usage analytics** — We don't track how you use the App, what screens you view, or how often you open it.
- **No advertising** — There are no ads in Buffr and no ad-related tracking.

## Information Stored On Your Device

All of the following data is stored locally on your device. This data is never transmitted to us or any third party:

- **Your RTO policy configuration** — Company name (if you choose to enter it), minimum days required, rolling window period, and your default weekly schedule.
- **Your day logs** — Records of your daily status (Office, WFH, Vacation, Sick, Holiday).
- **Your planned days** — Any future days you've scheduled in the calendar.
- **Your preferences** — App settings such as calculation adjustments and display options.

## Local Storage Only

Buffr stores all data locally on your device. Your data is not synced to iCloud or any cloud service. If you delete the app, your data is permanently deleted from your device.

## Optional Feedback

If you choose to submit feedback through the "Share Feedback" button in Settings:

- You will be directed to a Google Form (a third-party service operated by Google)
- Any information you provide in the form is collected by Google Forms
- We receive your feedback responses at our email (kruppesoftware@gmail.com)
- Feedback submission is entirely voluntary and optional
- We do not automatically collect any device information — only what you choose to type

Google's privacy practices apply to the feedback form. See [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for details.

## Third-Party Services

Buffr uses the following third-party services:

- **Apple App Store** — For app distribution and updates
- **Google Forms** — For optional user feedback (only if you choose to submit)

We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Data Security

Your data is protected by Apple's on-device encryption. We recommend:

- Using a passcode or Face ID/Touch ID on your device
- Keeping your iOS version up to date
- Enabling device encryption (on by default in iOS)

## Data Retention and Deletion

Your data remains on your device until you delete it. You can delete all Buffr data by:

- Using the "Clear All Data" option in Settings, or
- Deleting the App from your device

We have no data to delete on our end because we never receive it.

## Children's Privacy

Buffr is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
