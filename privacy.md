# Buffr Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** January 27, 2026

## Overview

Buffr ("the App") is designed with privacy as a core principle. Your data is stored on your device and synced to your personal iCloud account — never to our servers. We don't have accounts, we don't track you, and we don't sell data.

This Privacy Policy explains what information the App collects, how it's used, and your choices.

## Information We Do NOT Collect

- **No account or login** — You don't need to create an account to use Buffr.
- **No personal identifiers** — We don't collect your name, email, phone number, or any other personally identifiable information.
- **No location tracking** — The App does not access your GPS or location data.
- **No usage analytics** — We don't track how you use the App, what screens you view, or how often you open it.
- **No advertising** — There are no ads in Buffr and no ad-related tracking.

## Information Stored On Your Device

All of the following data is stored locally on your device and synced to your personal iCloud account. This data is never transmitted to us or any third party:

- **Your RTO policy configuration** — Company name (if you choose to enter it), minimum days required, rolling window period, and your default weekly schedule.
- **Your day logs** — Records of your daily status (Office, WFH, Vacation, Sick, Holiday).
- **Your planned days** — Any future days you've scheduled in the calendar.
- **Your preferences** — App settings such as calculation adjustments and display options.

## iCloud Sync

If you are signed into iCloud on your device, Buffr uses Apple's iCloud service to sync your data across your devices. This data is stored in your personal iCloud account, encrypted by Apple, and is not accessible to us. You can manage or disable iCloud sync through your device's Settings.

## Third-Party Services

Buffr does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

The App may connect to Apple's services for:
- **App Store** — For app updates
- **iCloud** — For syncing your data across your devices

## Data Security

Your data is protected by Apple's on-device encryption and iCloud encryption. We recommend:
- Using a passcode or Face ID/Touch ID on your device
- Keeping your iOS version up to date
- Enabling device encryption (on by default in iOS)

## Data Retention and Deletion

Your data remains on your device and in your iCloud account until you delete it. You can delete all Buffr data at any time by deleting the App from your device.

We have no data to delete on our end because we never receive it.

## Children's Privacy

Buffr is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. If we make significant changes, we'll update the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
